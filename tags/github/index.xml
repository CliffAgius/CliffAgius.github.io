      <description>What and Why? So, I have hosted my blog using Ghost on Azure Websites for over a year now and in that time I have found it hard to write blogs as much as I would like. The reason being that I tend to have a lot of time either in the air or downroute somewhere with no data connection, plus I found the Ghost offering for writing Offline not that easy.</description>
