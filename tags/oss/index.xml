      <description>Create your own Xamarin.Forms NuGet I am guessing that if you are here you have found a bug with Xamarin.Forms (Or A.N.Other OSS Project!) and you followed my previous blog Here to create your awesome fix and PR which you are awaiting review.
I had exactly this over the last week (Jan 2021) with a Memory Leak in the CollectionView control on UWP in a Xamarin.Forms project. The issue had been open for a while and you can see it here and there were various other issues related to the same problem, the good news is that the fault was found by @Gentledepp and they even created a fix AWESOME!</description>
