      <description>Xamarin.Forms NEW ExpanderControl Coming along in the new Xamarin.Forms 4.6 release which at the time of writing is at 4.6pre4 (So it&amp;rsquo;s due very soon!) is a new control called the ExpanderControl, now those of you that have played with Web will know this as the Accordian Control in that the user clicks/taps the element in the list and it expands to show more detail of that item.
This control has been added to Xamarin.</description>

      <description>Idea for a VisualStudio Tool for Xamarin In my last blog I wrote about all the different image sizes required for a Xamarin project and how to calculate them and size them and where to put them, it&amp;rsquo;s all very confusing when you first start out in mobile development so I hope that post helped&amp;hellip;
Recently (2019!) I was working on a standalone UWP project for a new instructor control station in the Mobile Flight Sim I helped to build, this sim is used by the airline I work for at School STEM events, Recruitment and fun corporate events.</description>

      <description>Working with Images In Xamarin Your just starting out developing a Xamarin app and wondering how you add an image, where they go and what sizes are needed. This is something I wondered when I first started and it took me a while to resolve it. The docs Images in Xamarin.Forms are very good (They all are really!) but still I was confused on the best approach. Well I was asked by someone I have been helping a little get into Xamarin Development so rather than just share with one person I thought a blog would be better.</description>

      <description>Finding and 3D Printing a Hand TLDR This is a long post as it&amp;rsquo;s the back story to the whole project and how it came about to getting a design for the hand, it covers the 3D design and printing as well as the problems along the way. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if your here hoping to see code and electronics or even the Xamarin App thats coming soon, I just need to explain where the Handy design came from first.</description>

      <description>Handy and the Big Picture Meet Kayden a Local 15 year old and the son of close friends, as you can see he is a happy teenager (They do exist!) full of fun and ready to take on the world&amp;hellip;
 You may also notice that Kayden was born without a left forearm and hand and is also missing the middle fingers on his right hand, so life is a challenge at times but it&amp;rsquo;s Ok the NHS (National Health Service here in the UK) are there to help free of charge (if you conveniently forget you pay TAX).</description>

      <description>10 steps to submitting your first Xamarin.Forms PR. As a Freelance Xamarin Dev I spend time now and then looking at the Xamarin Github to see if the issue I have been battling with is my code or some bug in Xamarin.Forms or maybe I am trying to work out why something isn&amp;rsquo;t working how I had hoped.
Now I am not saying by any stretch that Xamarin is a buggy code base far from it in the past year or two it has become very stable compared to previous years and yes there are bits here and there (Looking at you UWP!</description>

      <description>Custom Fonts and Icons in Xamarin.Forms Custom Fonts and using Icons in your project sounds like a lot of work and importing projects like FFImageLoading or Iconize both amazing packages but for this a bit of overkill (if you can get the icons as a font pack!).
So the first job is to get the custom font pack from the design team or the web and we want this in a .</description>

      <description>Live Player v Live Reload. So, your developing a Xamarin app and getting tired of the make a change, save the change, build the change, deploy the change notice you messed it up so starting the loop over again.
