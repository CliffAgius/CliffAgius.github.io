      <description>Create your own Xamarin.Forms NuGet I am guessing that if you are here you have found a bug with Xamarin.Forms (Or A.N.Other OSS Project!) and you followed my previous blog Here to create your awesome fix and PR which you are awaiting review.
I had exactly this over the last week (Jan 2021) with a Memory Leak in the CollectionView control on UWP in a Xamarin.Forms project. The issue had been open for a while and you can see it here and there were various other issues related to the same problem, the good news is that the fault was found by @Gentledepp and they even created a fix AWESOME!</description>

      <description>.Net 5 Thoughts As .Net5 is just around the corner scheduled release at .Net Conf 2020 which is November 10-12 I thought I would write a bit about my thoughts and what I have found about the up coming changes.
Now these are my thoughts (Hence the name!) but is based on Docs/Blogs/Podcasts/Meet-ups from Microsoft Team members but for the best and latest news take a look at the .Net Downloads Page for the latest release notes and roadmap.</description>

      <description>Xamarin.Forms NEW ExpanderControl Coming along in the new Xamarin.Forms 4.6 release which at the time of writing is at 4.6pre4 (So it&amp;rsquo;s due very soon!) is a new control called the ExpanderControl, now those of you that have played with Web will know this as the Accordian Control in that the user clicks/taps the element in the list and it expands to show more detail of that item.
This control has been added to Xamarin.</description>

      <description>Idea for a VisualStudio Tool for Xamarin In my last blog I wrote about all the different image sizes required for a Xamarin project and how to calculate them and size them and where to put them, it&amp;rsquo;s all very confusing when you first start out in mobile development so I hope that post helped&amp;hellip;
Recently (2019!) I was working on a standalone UWP project for a new instructor control station in the Mobile Flight Sim I helped to build, this sim is used by the airline I work for at School STEM events, Recruitment and fun corporate events.</description>

      <description>Working with Images In Xamarin Your just starting out developing a Xamarin app and wondering how you add an image, where they go and what sizes are needed. This is something I wondered when I first started and it took me a while to resolve it. The docs Images in Xamarin.Forms are very good (They all are really!) but still I was confused on the best approach. Well I was asked by someone I have been helping a little get into Xamarin Development so rather than just share with one person I thought a blog would be better.</description>

      <description>10 steps to submitting your first Xamarin.Forms PR. As a Freelance Xamarin Dev I spend time now and then looking at the Xamarin Github to see if the issue I have been battling with is my code or some bug in Xamarin.Forms or maybe I am trying to work out why something isn&amp;rsquo;t working how I had hoped.
Now I am not saying by any stretch that Xamarin is a buggy code base far from it in the past year or two it has become very stable compared to previous years and yes there are bits here and there (Looking at you UWP!</description>

      <description>Custom Fonts and Icons in Xamarin.Forms Custom Fonts and using Icons in your project sounds like a lot of work and importing projects like FFImageLoading or Iconize both amazing packages but for this a bit of overkill (if you can get the icons as a font pack!).
So the first job is to get the custom font pack from the design team or the web and we want this in a .</description>

      <description>Live Player v Live Reload. So, your developing a Xamarin app and getting tired of the make a change, save the change, build the change, deploy the change notice you messed it up so starting the loop over again.
