      <description>Finding and 3D Printing a Hand TLDR This is a long post as it&amp;rsquo;s the back story to the whole project and how it came about to getting a design for the hand, it covers the 3D design and printing as well as the problems along the way. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if your here hoping to see code and electronics or even the Xamarin App thats coming soon, I just need to explain where the Handy design came from first.</description>

      <description>Handy and the Big Picture Meet Kayden a Local 15 year old and the son of close friends, as you can see he is a happy teenager (They do exist!) full of fun and ready to take on the world&amp;hellip;
