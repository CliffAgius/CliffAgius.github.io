## About Me!

My Name is Clifford Agius but everyone just calls me Cliff unless I'm in trouble that is.

I am an Airline Pilot for a Major UK carrier and I have the fantastic priviledge to fly the Boeing 787 Dreamliner around the world from our home at London Heathrow.  This is an amazing aircraft that burns next to no fuel and carries either 217 (-8/-9) or 256 (-10) passengers in comfort at Mach 0.85.

When I'm not flying I spend my time working as a freelance .Net, Xamarin and IoT Developer working on various client and Open Source projects (Like #Handy & #Leggy).  I was awarded Microsoft MVP in 2020-2021 for my work in the community where I enjoy giving talks at Meet-ups and International Conferences about Xamarin/IoT.

I have an amazing and supportive wife Mrs A! as well as 3 boys and two dogs, so life is busy but I wouldn't want it any other way.
