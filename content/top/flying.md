## Flying and Aviation

I will from time to time write a post about aviation and flying the Boeing 787 around the world.  I have been asked many times to do this but never really known what to write about, so if you have an idea of a subject you want to hear about the world of Aviation/Flying drop me an email and let me know.

For now here are some nice pictures for you to enjoy...

## Aurora Borealis

We Get some amazing views of the Aurora Borealis out of the flight deck window while the passengers are sleeping. Best office window in the world.

## Aurora Out the Window

I couldn't hold the camera still enough for the exposure time hence it's a little shaky!

## HUD Rise.

One that I guarantee every B787 pilot has taken and has more than a few on their phone.

## Sunrise

As the flightdeck is often very dark and we have night adjusted our eyes we get some amazing views of the stars/planets and milkyway... Then the sun comes up as it tends to do and tries to burn our eye but the view is still amazing.

## Melting Ice Caps

I have been flying across the Atlantic/Greenland for over 10 years now and in that short time I have noticed the changing landscape.  We often now see the Fjords of Greenland almost clear of Ice in the summer.
