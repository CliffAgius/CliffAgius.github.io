## Flying and Aviation

I will from time to time write a post about aviation and flying the Boeing 787 around the world.  I have been asked many times to do this but never really known what to write about, so if you have an idea of a subject you want to hear about the world of Aviation/Flying drop me an email and let me know.

For now here are some nice pictures for you to enjoy...
