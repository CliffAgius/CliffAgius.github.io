## Speaking

I am always happy to give talks on Xamarin/IoT especially if it's around projects I am working on, as well as Team Skills from the Aviation world.  

You can find my Talks on my [Sessionize Speaker Profile](https://sessionize.com/clifford-agius/)

If you interested in having me along at your Meet-Up/Conference/Podcast to talk then please just email me [CliffordAgius@CA-Software.Co.uk](mailto:cliffordagius@ca-software.co.uk)
